<blockquote>
<p>Don't confuse motion with action.
<em>Benjamin Franklin</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people think productivity is about doing more.</p>
<p>More hours.</p>
<p>More output.</p>
<p>More checkmarks on a to-do list.</p>
<p>More “hustle”.</p>
<p>That’s the message we constantly get from school, work culture, social media, and books.</p>
<p>We always need to do more, or otherwise we will “fall behind”.</p>
<p>We can't rest anymore without feeling guilty.</p>
<p>We try to distract ourselves from the discomfort.</p>
<p>So we scroll through Instagram, watching people our age travel the world, build creative careers, and live “perfect” lives.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling inspired, we start to compare.</p>
<p>And with each scroll, we sink a little deeper.</p>
<p>We get trapped.</p>
<p>But maybe there's another way.</p>
<p>What if there is a different way to approach productivity?</p>
<p>A healthier, more meaningful way.</p>
<p>One that not only improves your well-being but also helps you reach your goals faster.</p>
<p>The key lies not in <strong>motion</strong>, but in <strong>intention</strong>.</p>
<p>This way of thinking flips the perspective and invites depth.</p>
<p>It shifts focus from <em>quantity</em> to <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>From <em>external performance</em> to <em>internal motivation</em>.</p>
<p>From <em>mindless action</em> to <em>intentional living</em>.</p>
<p>That's what this letter is about.</p>
<p>Let's start!</p>
<h2>Understanding The Two Productivity Modes</h2>
<p>Lately, I’ve been struggling with productivity.</p>
<p>I moved from a quiet town in Germany to the chaotic, yet beautiful city of Istanbul.</p>
<p>new culture.</p>
<p>new people.</p>
<p>new environment.</p>
<p>new experiences.</p>
<p>And yet, something inside me couldn’t fully settle.</p>
<p>It was all exciting, but something held me back from truly enjoying it.</p>
<p>My old routines didn’t work anymore, and my productivity dropped.</p>
<p>I started blaming myself.</p>
<p>I tried to force myself to get back to work, but the energy wasn’t there.</p>
<p>So I paused…</p>
<p>tooked a step back and question myself about how I defined productivity in the first place.</p>
<p>Slowly, a new perspective began to form.</p>
<p>The first shift came when I realized this:</p>
<p>There are two core forces that drive productivity:</p>
<p><strong>Survival and Aspiration.</strong></p>
<p>Most of our actions fall somewhere along the spectrum between these two forces.</p>
<p>Both can help us to be more productive.</p>
<p>However, one of them has many negative consequences.</p>
<h3>Aspiration Mode vs. Survival Mode</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“We get lost in doing, in the urgency of survival, and we forget we are human beings.”<br>
<em>– Tara Brach</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In today’s culture, productivity is often driven by survival.</p>
<p>You open TikTok or Instagram and see 20-year-olds talking about their six-figure businesses, their morning routines at 5 a.m., their side hustles, gym progress, and “no excuses” mindset.</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with ambition or routines, when these highlight reels become our benchmarks, it can create unrealistic expectations and distort our perception of what’s “normal” or “enough.”</p>
<p>Productivity turns into pressure.</p>
<p>Work becomes a way to prove we’re valuable.</p>
<p>That’s <strong>survival mode.</strong></p>
<p>When we think of survival mode, we often imagine extreme situations like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danger</li>
<li>Hunger</li>
<li>Cold</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there's another kind, less obvious but with just as much impact:</p>
<p><em>psychological survival.</em></p>
<p>That’s when what’s under threat isn’t our body but our <em>identity</em>.</p>
<p>Our sense of self.</p>
<p>Psychological survival starts when we feel our self-worth, social mask, or belonging is in danger.</p>
<p>It’s the panic when we’re rejected.</p>
<p>The shutdown when we feel unseen.</p>
<p>The overthinking after a social slip-up.</p>
<p>In these moments, we’re not trying to stay alive, we’re trying to stay someone.</p>
<p>Someone coherent, valuable, safe in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Because we don’t exist in isolation. We constantly build our identity in relation to others, how they see us, how we want to be seen, who we believe we are.</p>
<p>So when something shakes that, it can feel like a threat to the self itself.</p>
<p>And the mind goes into survival mode.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Istanbul, I noticed that my urge to be productive arose from the fear of falling behind.</p>
<p>The feeling that everyone else is moving faster, doing more, becoming better, while I'm stuck.</p>
<p>Comparison on overdrive.</p>
<p>That's why my inner stage changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt stressed and anxious.</li>
<li>I got perfectionistic.</li>
<li>I felt burned out.</li>
<li>I lost creativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting out of survival mode narrows our lens on productivity.</p>
<p>You either distract yourself from or get into tunnel vision.</p>
<p>Moving, but not seeing.</p>
<p>Like sprinting toward a destination without ever stopping to check if you’re on the right road.</p>
<p>Though it can be helpful at times, relying on it as your <strong>primary motivator</strong> often comes at a cost.</p>
<p>Survival mode doesn't allow rest,</p>
<p>or experimentation,</p>
<p>or introspection,</p>
<p>or play.</p>
<p>The only rule is to be in <em>motion</em>.</p>
<p>Yet there is an important difference between being in <em>motion</em> and taking the highest leverage <em>action.</em></p>
<p>To achieve the second option, we have to switch to Aspiration Mode.</p>
<p>This mode is different.</p>
<p>It doesn't narrow but expands our lens.</p>
<p>Our definition of productivity widens.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly sprinting down the first road, we allow ourselves to stop, study the map, and take the best path to our desired destination.</p>
<p>When acting from aspiration, the underlying motivations are our values, curiosity, and desire to create something meaningful.</p>
<p>It’s about the <strong>why</strong> behind what you do.</p>
<p>Instead of forcing yourself into a static system working like a robot, this approach allows more flexibility.</p>
<p>What’s the best thing I can do right now to move in the right direction?</p>
<p>To help you answer this question, I will give you a framework of the four different phases you could be in right now and how to change your definition of productivity accordingly.</p>
<h2>The 4 Phases Of Every Project</h2>
<img src="/assets/Images/2025-19-04/02.png" alt="">
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To everything there is a season. A time to be born, a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up; A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up.&quot;<br>
<em>- Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each creative project is composed of four phases.</p>
<p>You can zoom in or out.</p>
<p>Apply it to your entire life, a season, an artwork, or even a single idea.</p>
<p>The pattern stays the same. The scale is up to you.</p>
<p>The first phase, with which everything begins, is one of being in between chapters.</p>
<p>It's the <strong>Lost Phase.</strong></p>
<h3>The Lost Phase</h3>
<p>You feel stuck or low.</p>
<p>Nothing makes sense.</p>
<p>You need rest, time alone, and space to think.</p>
<p>It's like standing on a crossroad with unlimited different directions to go down.</p>
<p>It's overwhelming.</p>
<p>We feel the need to distract ourselves from this discomfort, which leads us to stay longer in this phase.</p>
<p>Instead, try to shift your perspective and see these things as being productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring creativity</li>
<li>Embracing new experiences</li>
<li>Connecting with new people</li>
<li>Spending time alone</li>
<li>Meditating</li>
<li>Traveling</li>
<li>Writing</li>
</ul>
<p>This phase is all about checking in with our values, reflecting on earlier choices, and sitting still in uncertainty until the right direction appears.</p>
<h3>The Spark Phase</h3>
<p>A new idea or goal gives you direction.</p>
<p>You feel more energy, hope, and motivation.</p>
<p>You finally found the one road you want to go down.</p>
<p>These things become our definition of productivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimenting</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Gathering Inspiration</li>
<li>Creative play</li>
</ul>
<p>It's all about Inspiration and quality input, which helps us define the next steps we have to take.</p>
<h3>The Flow Phase</h3>
<p>You're in the flow.</p>
<p>Things are working.</p>
<p>You're making progress and feeling strong.</p>
<p>When having this momentum, the standard “hustle” advice becomes more practical.</p>
<p>Now, working for long hours and focusing on one thing becomes the definition of productivity.</p>
<p>However, the difference is that it gives you energy instead of taking it, because now you are not running away but towards something.</p>
<h3>The End Phase</h3>
<p>It starts to feel old or empty.</p>
<p>Your energy drops.</p>
<p>It's time to finish and move on.</p>
<p>You either achieved your goal or failed.</p>
<p>Either way, it was successful.</p>
<p>You learned a lot and revealed one more layer about yourself.</p>
<p>In this phase, productivity is all about finding an end, finishing the work, and enjoying the view you arrived at.</p>
<p>Till everything starts from the beginning again.</p>
<p>So to sum this up:</p>
<p>When you're in aspiration mode, you’re more aligned with your values, creativity, and long-term goals. This makes it easier to be aware of your current phase and act accordingly, instead of forcing yourself into a single, rigid productivity standard.</p>
<p>Some days, it’s all about making progress and staying focused.</p>
<p>Other days, it’s about taking a step back and figuring out what’s even worth focusing on.</p>
<p>Moving to Istanbul taught me that productivity looks different depending on where you are in life.</p>
<p>For me, it was a season of new experiences, meeting people, exploring ideas, and reading books that sparked my new interest in writing.</p>
<p>That’s what led to this letter.</p>
<p>I’m publishing a new one every two weeks to help you stay consistent on your creative path.</p>
<p>The purpose is to offer reminders to stay on track, because in the chaos of daily life, it’s easy to forget sometimes.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
